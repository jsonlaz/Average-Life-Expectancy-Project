# Average-Life-Expectancy-Project

This project analyses and explores the relationships between life expectancy and various socioeconomic factors in different regions of the world using Excel. It aims to provide a clear and concise overview of how factors like education levels, mortality rates, and economic development influence longevity.

## Dataset

Average Life Expectancy Analysis (2007). [Click Raw Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasg23/life-expectancy-averaged-dataset) to see the dataset on Kaggle and the data description.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed in Microsoft Excel. It consists of the following key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
    - Handle missing values in relevant columns.
    - Standardized the data.
    - Create and add (if needed) new columns for analysis.
    - Address inconsistencies in Country and Region.
    - Remove unwanted columns.

2. **Descriptive Analysis:**
    - Cumulative Life Expectancy, Mortality Rate, and GDP per capita by region.
    - Average Years of Education.

3. **Customer Behavior Analysis:**
    - Analyze purchase patterns by product category, payment method, and customer segment.
    - Visualize sales trends over time.
    - Identify preferred payment methods by customer segment.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
    - Comparative Analysis by Regions.
    - Comparative Analysis by Economic Status

## Visualizations

The dashboard provides a visual overview of key factors influencing life expectancy across different regions, categorized by "Developed" and "Developing" economic statuses.

## Results:

- ﻿﻿Developed regions generally have higher life expectancies and average years of education compared to developing regions.
- There's significant variation in life expectancy and education levels within both developed and developing categories, suggesting other factors beyond just economic status are at play.
- Mortality rates, particularly infant and under-5, appear to be higher in some regions compared to others, hinting at disparities in healthcare and living conditions.﻿﻿ 
- GDP per capita shows a wide range across regions, likely correlating with the observed differences in life expectancy and education.

## Conclusion

The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool for exploring the complex factors that contribute to life expectancy. It allows for quick comparisons across regions and economic statuses, highlighting disparities and potential correlations between socioeconomic indicators and longevity.
